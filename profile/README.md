# Preface
So HBO-ICT consists of 8 semesters. To pass a semester you have to touch all the learning outcomes. The way you do this doesn't really matter as long as you keep good contact with your teachers and ask active feedback. Here's a quick terminology so you won't get lost later on.

### Terminology

**Semester**: 6 months of school

**Learning Outcome**: A certain skill you need to learn before the end of the semester. A semester has multiple learning outcomes.

# [Semester 1 - Media](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/media-semester-1)
My first semester on ICT. In this semester I followed 5 subject: Software, Business, Infrastructure, Technology and Media. One project I made was rather bigger than the others -> [Letter Sprong](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/media-semester-1/tree/master/Media)

**Grade: Satisfactory**

# [Semester 1 - Software](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/software-semester-1)
a few weeks into semester 2 Media I decided it was nothing for me. I wanted to do software, but to switch to software, I had to pass software semester 1. In this semester 1 I only followed software. Since I already understood the basics of coding and spent quite some time in my vacation on coding, this semester was quite easy. Noticeable projects I made are -> [BattleSim](https://github.com/CrossyChainsaw/BattleSim), [DinoGame](https://github.com/CrossyChainsaw/DinoGame)

**Grade: Outstanding**

# [Semester 2 - Software](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/software-semester-2)
Software semester 2 is usually referred to as the hardest semester of the study. Topics mentioned in this semester are: databases, MVC project (and the layer structure), Unit Testing, Lots of documentation, Algorithms. A noticeable project I made this semester is -> [CircusTrein](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/software-semester-2/tree/main/semester-2-repository/CircusTrein) 

**Grade: Good**

# [Semester 3 - Software](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/software-semester-3)
In semester 3 we had to make a portfolio. So the entire page you see there, That's what I've actually been graded for. The page itself is an actual masterpiece. Topics in this semester are: CI/CD, Code Analysis, Scrum, Full-Stack Developement, API and Micro Services. Noticeable projects I made this semester are -> [AutoClicker](https://github.com/CrossyChainsaw/AutoClicker), [Ranknir](https://github.com/Skyward-Brawlhalla/Ranknir)

**Grade: Good**

# [Semester 4 - Artifical intelligence](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/AI-semester-4)
For semester 4 I chose the specialisation AI. You might be wondering why I didn't choose game-design. But the future in game-design isn't that big and I see it more as a hobby thing. In this semester I made my first steps into AI. Topics you can find back are Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Classification, Object Detection, Object Tracking, API, Python, Jupyter-Notebook. Noticeable projects I made this semester -> [Brawlhalla Legend Classification](https://github.com/CrossyChainsaw/Brawlhalla-Legend-Classification), [Cart Pole Game](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/AI-semester-4/tree/main/Open%20Program)

**Grade: Good**

# [Semester 5 - Software Internship](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/software-internship-semester-5)
In this semester I made a Serious Game for PIT (Practoraat Interactief Technologie). This game prepares Automotive Students on practical tasks. You will also find a bit of research in this documents. 

**Grade: Satisfactory**

# [Semester 6 - Artifical intelligence Advanced (WIP)](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries/AI-semester-6)
MRR-Drones, Brawlhalla-Bot, All Exercises, Data-Challange, WIP...

**Grade: Good**
